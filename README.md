# Assignment_7---Rolling_Stone_500_Greatest_Songs
The main goal of this project was to determine which artist and genre reoccurred the most in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs. Additionally, I was also interested in discovering through bivariate analysis if there was a relation between TIME/BPM and BPM/YEAR between the songs in this data. The API used to collect this data was BeautifulSoup.
